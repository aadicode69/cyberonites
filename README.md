## Overview
The Cyberonites Club website serves as a hub for tech enthusiasts, students, and professionals to connect, share resources, and explore topics in cybersecurity and software development. Built with a modern frontend stack, this project leverages Vite’s fast build system and React’s component-based architecture to deliver a performant and scalable web experience.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Fast Development**: Hot Module Replacement (HMR) via Vite for real-time updates during development.
- **Code Quality**: ESLint rules to ensure consistent and maintainable code.
- **Modern Frontend**: Built with React for dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **Deployed Previews**: Accessible via Vercel for testing and showcasing.

## Installation
To set up the Cyberonites Club website locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aadicode69/cyberonites.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd cyberonites
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Run the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The website will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified by Vite).

## Usage
- **Development**: Run `npm run dev` to start the development server with HMR. Edit files in the `src/` directory to see changes reflected instantly in the browser.
- **Build for Production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This generates optimized static assets in the `dist/` directory.
- **Preview Production Build**:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```
   This serves the production build locally for testing.
- **Accessing the Website**: Visit the deployed versions for testing or reference:
  - Testing & Reference: [https://aaditya-cyberonites.vercel.app/](https://aaditya-cyberonites.vercel.app/)
  - Preview: [https://cyberonites-alpha.vercel.app/](https://cyberonites-alpha.vercel.app/)

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React (v18.x)
- **Build Tool**: Vite (v4.x or higher)
- **Linting**: ESLint (configured with standard React rules)
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **Styling**: [Add specifics if known, e.g., Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules, or vanilla CSS]

## Available Plugins
This project supports two official Vite plugins for React:
- **`@vitejs/plugin-react`**: Uses Babel for Fast Refresh, enabling real-time updates without losing component state.
- **`@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`**: Uses SWC (Speedy Web Compiler) for faster Fast Refresh, offering a lightweight alternative to Babel.

To switch between plugins, update the `vite.config.js` file as needed. Example configuration:
```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react' // or '@vitejs/plugin-react-swc'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
})
```

## Deployment
The project is deployed on Vercel for easy access and testing:
- **Testing & Reference Site**: [https://aaditya-cyberonites.vercel.app/](https://aaditya-cyberonites.vercel.app/) – A site for project documentation or personal reference (e.g., Aaditya’s portfolio).
- **Preview Site**: [https://cyberonites-alpha.vercel.app/](https://cyberonites-alpha.vercel.app/) – A live preview of the Cyberonites Club website in its alpha stage.

To deploy your own instance:
1. Push the repository to a GitHub account.
2. Connect the repository to Vercel via the Vercel dashboard.
3. Configure build settings (Vite defaults: `npm run build` for build, `dist/` for output).
4. Deploy and access your custom URL.
